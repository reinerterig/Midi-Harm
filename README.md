# Midi-Harm
Polyphonic harmoniser for Monome Norns based off pitchShiftPA quark.

Currently for script to work the user must run 'Quarks.install("https://github.com/dyfer/PitchShiftPA");' in the Maiden SuperCollider Repl.

To Do:
1. Include a way for to automatically check if user has PitchShiftPA installed on their Norns and run the install command in the back ground.
2. add some visuals on the screen using p8 lib.
3. improve pitch tracking and phasing.
4. add formant control either using velocity, after touch, or random seeds.
